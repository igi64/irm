A place to explore ideas and experiment with WebRTC and Identity (Relationship) Management.

Problem: Every single WebRTC browser client is de facto IoT node. We need dynamic and flexible inter-domain OAuth2 identity pairing system.

Goal: The goal of this framework is to support inter-domain trust management of relationships between publishing and subscribing sides that use IRM.

Task: Evaluate publish subscribe relationship as a layer above OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

Use cases:
- Access Management for [WebRTC, Identity-Based Encryption Key Generator](https://github.com/igi64/airykey).
- Relationship Management for [WebRTC, Rich Communication Suite](https://github.com/igi64/Drop.Camp).
